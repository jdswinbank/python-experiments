# Python/C++ interface next steps

These are notes following a presentation at the May 2015 DMLT meeting.

## Shims

There was agreement at the meeting that it was desirable to adjust the public interface of the existing SWIG classes to be more pythonic. There was encouragement to continue with the python experimental classes and make a proposal. In particular:

- Agreement to using keyword arguments for constructors and validating inputs before passing them to the C++ constructor (thus avoiding the unexpectedly confusing stack trace). The extra typing involved by the user was thought to be a small price to pay for enhanced clarity.
- `dtype=float32` style constructors were thought to be a good approach for code clarity as long as there was a reasonable default.
- We have to solve how to add documentation to the shim, although, since there is no documentation in the SWIG-generated interface at the moment this should not slow down deployment internally.
- There were no objections to adopting PEP-8 naming conventions for methods (underscores not camelcase). (PEP-8 coding conventions in general and automatic usage of flake8 needs to be addressed).
- These interfaces should coexist with the SWIGged interfaces and so can not clash.

No-one thought it was worthwhile writing pure python implementations of `Point`, `Extent` and `Box`.

Making astropy an official dependency was not discussed. This would be required if we were to make it possible to use quantity and coordinates (For example) in the python layer, whilst converting them to and from the C++ object equivalents inside the shim. It would be desirable to make this decision before lots of code is refactored to use the shim interfaces.

I believe there was a proposal to consider changing some of the SWIG interface. This might be useful but would have the disadvantage of having to modify existing code. With the `lsstx` approach to adopting the new interface we can migrate systems a bit at a time, allowing the interface to evolve as we gain experience.

## Pushing down the C++

It was felt that rather than rewrite `Exposure` in pure python and pass the components to C++, that we should spend time working out how to pass python objects to the C++ layer through the SWIG interface. The C++ code could then query the python object for the required information (assuming this was done outside of tight loops).

It was felt to be important that it should be possible for `Exposure` to be able to have Python objects inside it and that these objects would be available to the C++ internals. It was also stated that unpacking `Exposure` and sending individual objects to C++ was the stretch goal and that Python objects in a C++ `Exposure` was the simple short term approach. __This clearly needs more discussion__.

## Interfaces to C++

Whilst the `numba`/`cython` investigation was deemed to be interesting, no-one felt it compelling enough to switch to it given that it is already slower than the existing C++ code and we have reason to believe that the C++ code is too slow. There was some discussion on replacing SWIG with [`boost.python`](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_58_0/libs/python/doc/) or [`mcpib`](https://github.com/TallJimbo/mcpib). Both the latter tools would provide a significantly more pythonic API. `mcpib` looks to be extremely nice (extensive use of C++11 along with use of `libclang` to parse the C++) but is still not ready for primetime and would require a few person-months effort to get it working for our system. Everyone agreed that SWIG was a disaster but no consensus was reached in replacing it.
